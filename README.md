# Horiseon Digital Marketing

## Bootcamp Coding Challenge 1

**A fully responsive and accessible landing page for the digital marketing firm, Horiseon**

<div>
<img src="./assets/images/full-site.png" alt="Screenshot of full webpage"  style="width: 250px;"/> </div>

###Problems Solved:

- Refactored HTML code to use semantic elements.
- Refactored CSS to adhere to the DRY code concept.
- Optimized images for a lighter application and faster page load.
- Replaced the Float properties with more up to date Flexbox and Grid properties.
- Added media queries to make the site fully responsive on desktop and mobile.

- In the header I added a hamburger icon along with a pop out nav menu for screen sizes below 600px.

<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td style="border:none">
<img
      src="./assets/images/responsive_1.png"
      alt="Screenshot of responsive layout"
      style="width: 250px; height: 350px;"
    />
</td>
<td style="border:none">
 <img
      src="./assets/images/responsive_2.png"
      alt="Screenshot of responsive layout"
style="width: 250px; height: 350px;"
    />
</td>
<td style="border:none">
<img
      src="./assets/images/responsive_menu.png"
      alt="Screenshot of responsive nav menu"
style="width: 250px; height: 350px;"
/>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
